# CSS601A2 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence Assignment 2

This assignment deals topics such as reinforcement learning and Markov Decision Processes. Questions as well as responses are written in `LaTeX`.

## Question 1 - Search Algorithms
Covers DFS, BFS, Best First Search and A* Search. Also covers *admissibility* and *consistency*.

## Question 2 - Self Driving Car Simulator
Covers the concepts of reinforcement learning. Uses A* Search.

## Question 3 - Markov Decision Process
Determine optimal policy $\pi$ for a taxi pickup MDP model with given $V_0$ and $\gamma$. Compute three iterations.

## Question 4 - Q-Learning with OpenAI gym
Implements a basic Q-Learning algorithm for `FrozenLake` environment assuming $\gamma=0.95$ and charts episodic return.

## Question 5 - Word Similarity using Natural Language Processing
Process text corpus of movie review and use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to generate word vectors, and compare with `Word2Vec` from `gensim` on basis of cosine-similarity.
