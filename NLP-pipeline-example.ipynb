Look at these two sentences:\n","\n","I had a pony.\n","\n","I had two ponies.\n","\n","Both sentences talk about the noun pony, but they are using different inflections. When working with text in a computer, it is helpful to know the base form of each word so that you know that both sentences are talking about the same concept.

English has a lot of filler words that appear very frequently like “and”, “the”, and “a”. When doing statistics on text, these words introduce a lot of noise since they appear way more frequently than other words. Some NLP pipelines will flag them as stop words —that is, words that you might want to filter out before doing any statistical analysis.\n","\n","## Step 6a: Dependency Parsing\n","The next step is to figure out how all the words in our sentence relate to each other. This is called dependency parsing.\n","\n","The goal is to build a tree that assigns a single parent word to each word in the sentence. The root of the tree will be the main verb in the sentence. Here’s what the beginning of the parse tree will look like for our sentence:\n","\n","## Step 6b: Finding Noun Phrases\n","Sometimes it makes more sense to group together the words that represent a single idea or thing. We can use the information from the dependency parse tree to automatically group together words that are all talking about the same

Humans can keep track of what these words represent based on context. But our NLP model doesn’t know what pronouns mean because it only examines one sentence at a time.\n","\n","Let’s look at the third sentence in our paragraph:“It was founded by the Romans, who named it Londinium.”\n","\n","As a human reading this sentence, you can easily Dgure out that “it” means “London”.
